Ergo
====

Many of us, especially students and office workers, sit our lives away; this has been linked to high blood pressure, obesity, worse mental health, and more. ERGO is a web app that combats the discomfort and injury that results from a sedentary lifestyle by periodically alerting users to stretch. Designed to work across many different spaces, ERGO is unique in that it introduces exercises that use the everyday objects around us, inspiring users to rethink their interactions with their spatial environments.
